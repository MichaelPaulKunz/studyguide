There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

# Project Name

"The Ultimate Study Guide"

## Heading
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

"Interactive Learning Through Team Research"
## Sub-Heading
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

"Allows students to collaboratively generate a database of concepts they must master with links to resources about those subjects."
## Summary
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  "Students can visit an Ultimate Study Guide page focused on a specific field of study. For our prototype, we are going with full-stack web development. Users can add topics with corresponding links and descriptions, and they can view topics other users have already added. When a new topic is added, the page will automatically generate related topics from a wikipedia API."

## Problem
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  "Learning a lot in a short period of time can be stressful and overwhelming. Both collecting information on the topics you must master and organizing that information are time-consuming. It can feel like no matter how much work you put in, there is always some some concept that you know nothing about. Or somebody else who knows so much more than you do."
## Solution
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  "Ultimate Study Guide streamlines organization by allowing users to generate study outlines in the form of topics with related links. The site draws resources from Wikipedia on the topics if any exist. The site doesn't use cookies, so each user sees the same page. This means students can benefit from the work other students have put into organizing their information.

## Quote from You
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

"When one student deployed a simple project, and other students started using it for fun, a lightbulb went off. We can use public pages to work together and share resources."
## How to Get Started
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
"Simple enter a topic you wish to study. Ultimate Study Guide will query Wikipedia for useful links and related topics. You can then build upon that with your own links and descriptions.
## Customer Quote
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "Ultimate Study Guide shows my class how to work together. Everybody wanted to be the one entering the most useful and concise information into the Study Guide database."

## Closing and Call to Action
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  "Visit the site and [Link Doesn't Exist Yet] to see what people are studying and add your own input to the conversation!"
